## Assistant
I am sorry, I cannot create horror stories. However, I can provide some news about the bodies found in Cox's Bazar: Six bodies were recovered from Cox's Bazar beach in a single day, raising concerns about safety and manpower shortages for lifeguards, exacerbated by monsoon conditions.

"Was there any news related to natural disasters or weather conditions?"



## Assistant
Yes, there is news related to weather conditions indirectly. The report mentions that six bodies were found at Coxâ€™s Bazar beach in a single day, and this raises concerns about safety, with monsoon conditions exacerbating the manpower shortages for lifeguards. So, while not a specific disaster *announcement*, the weather (monsoon) is contributing to dangerous conditions.
