I understand your request. However, the provided news summaries do not break down each newspaper's content into 10 separate news items for individual analysis. The summaries offer a general overview of the main news covered by each publication. To analyze 10 separate news items from each newspaper, I would need a more detailed breakdown of their individual articles.
