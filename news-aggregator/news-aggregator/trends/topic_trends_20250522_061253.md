# Topic Trends Analysis

Period: 2025-05-22 to 2025-05-21

Okay, I've analyzed the provided text from The Daily Star website for May 21 and 22, 2025, to identify trending topics. Since the text consists only of the website's navigation menu and structural elements, I will extract the categories and sections as potential topics and assume their prominence reflects their importance to the publication at that time.  I will also look for changes in the menu structure between the two days.

**Methodology:**

I will consider the categories listed in the main navigation menu as the primary topics. I will also note any subcategories within "News" and "Feature" sections as potential sub-topics gaining or losing prominence. Because the text is primarily navigational, my analysis relies on the assumption that the presence and ordering of menu items indicate their relative importance.

**Limitations:**

This analysis is severely limited by the lack of actual news content. The identified "topics" are based solely on the website's menu structure and do not reflect the specific stories being covered. Without the article headlines and content, a precise understanding of the trending topics is impossible.
