# Topic Trends Analysis

Period: 2025-05-22 to 2025-05-21

Okay, I can analyze these news articles to identify trending topics over time. However, since you only provided the table of contents and main navigation of the website, I can only analyze based on the *categories* of news provided, not the specific article content.

**Assumptions:**

*   The frequency of links to a category within the navigation reflects the importance or coverage volume of that topic.
*   Changes in the order or addition of categories indicates a shift in priorities or emerging topics.

### Overall Structure of Analysis

1.  **Topic Identification:** Extracting categories from the provided links.
2.  **Coverage Assessment:** Judging coverage levels based on the frequency and prominence of categories.
3.  **Trend Analysis:** Comparing category presence across dates to identify rising, falling, or consistent topics.
4.  **Emerging Topics:** Identifying new categories appearing in later dates.

## Analysis of News Article Categories

#### Methodology:

Each link found in the navigation will be categorized as a topic and the presence of that topic noted for each day. Topics will be classified based on their presence in the top levels of navigation
