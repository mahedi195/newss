The report mentions that six bodies were found at Coxâ€™s Bazar beach in a single day, and this raises concerns about safety, with monsoon conditions exacerbating the manpower shortages for lifeguards. So, while not a specific disaster *announcement*, the weather (monsoon) is contributing to dangerous conditions.
