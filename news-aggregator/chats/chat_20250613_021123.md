Yes, there is significant news from June 12th, 2025.  The most prominent story is a major Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, resulting in a large number of fatalities.  This is reported across all news sources.  Another important event is a meeting between Dr. Muhammad Yunus and Tarique Rahman in London, which is generating considerable discussion about its potential impact on Bangladesh's political future.  Finally,  Manobkantha reports that Sheikh Hasina and her daughter Rehana have left the country,  but this requires further verification from other sources.
